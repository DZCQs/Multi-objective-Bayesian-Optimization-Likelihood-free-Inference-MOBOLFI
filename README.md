# Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization Likelihood-free Inference (MOBOLFI)

MOBOLFI is an extension of [BOLFI](https://github.com/elfi-dev/notebooks/blob/master/BOLFI.ipynb) that optimizes multiple training objectives in training a multi-variate surrogate. While sharing the sample efficiency from BOLFI, MOBOLFI exhibits approximate posterior conditional on different data sources, indicating potential model mis-specification caused by conflict information.

## Examples
Three examples comprise of the code used in our [publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01735). The first two examples are The dataset. If you wish to re-run the parameterization yourself,
