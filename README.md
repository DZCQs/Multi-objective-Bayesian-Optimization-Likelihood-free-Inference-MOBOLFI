# Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization Likelihood-free Inference (MOBOLFI)

MOBOLFI is an extension of [BOLFI](https://github.com/elfi-dev/notebooks/blob/master/BOLFI.ipynb) that optimizes multiple training objectives in training a multi-variate surrogate. While sharing the sample efficiency from BOLFI, MOBOLFI exhibits approximate posterior conditional on different data sources, indicating potential model mis-specification caused by conflict information.

## Examples
Three examples comprise of the code are used in our [publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01735). To reproduce the experiments yourself, follow the .ipynb notebooks with detail codes comments for direction. Trained models (.sav), generated figures (.pdf/.png), intermediate results, training data and mcmc samples (.txt) are left in file folders. Observation datasets of mlba example (et_chocie_resultf5.csv/empirical_data.csv) are attached to the folder mlba_synthtic/mlba_empirical, respectively.
